# I did this so that medron.org can be the ladning page, but they have to go
# to core to get into the core functionality. The actual core page will be
# blank similar to theonion.com's /section/ page

# TODO re-think this so that people can access doctors from .../doctors/2
# instead of .../core/doctors/2
